# Spring Boot

This guide demonstrates how to create a Spring Boot backend project using Spring Initializr, configured for MongoDB database interaction, with Maven and Java 17.

**Prerequisites:**

- **Java 17:** Download and install from [Java Downloads | Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
- **Maven:** Download and install from [Maven â€“ Download Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- **Web browser**

**Project Setup:**

1. **Open Spring Initializr:** Navigate to [https://start.spring.io/](https://start.spring.io/).
2. **Project:** Choose "Maven Project".
3. **Language:** Select "Java".
4. **Spring Boot:** Specify "3.2.7".
5. **Dependencies:**
   - Add "Spring Web" for building RESTful APIs.
   - Add "Spring Data MongoDB" for interacting with a MongoDB database.
   - Consider including "Lombok" (optional) to reduce boilerplate code (install it in your IDE if desired).
6. **Project Metadata:**
   - Group: `com.spring.server`
   - Artifact: `server`
   - Name: `server`
   - Description: `Spring backend project`
   - Package name: `com.spring.server`
   - Packaging: `Jar`
   - Java: `17`
7. **Generate:** Click the "Generate" button to download the ZIP file.

**Project Structure:**

The downloaded ZIP file will contain a basic Spring Boot project structure with necessary dependencies included in `pom.xml`.

**Optional: Install Lombok:**

If you chose to use Lombok, follow your IDE's instructions to install the Lombok plugin for code generation features.

**Building and Running the Application:**

1. **Extract the ZIP file:** Unzip the downloaded file into a suitable directory.
2. **Navigate to the project directory:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the extracted directory (e.g., using `cd server`).
3. **Build the project:** Run `mvn package` in the terminal. This creates a JAR file in the `target` directory, containing your compiled application code.
4. **Run the application:** Run `java -jar target/server.jar` in the terminal. This starts the Spring Boot application.

**Verification:**

Once the application starts, it should typically listen on port 8080 (default). You can verify this by opening `http://localhost:8080` in your web browser. If configured correctly, you might see a basic Spring Boot welcome message or information about exposed endpoints.

**Next Steps:**

- **Develop your application:** Add controllers, services, and repositories to build your backend functionality.
- **Configure Spring Data MongoDB:** Explore Spring Data MongoDB annotations and classes to interact with your MongoDB database. Spring Boot provides automatic configuration for a local MongoDB instance on the default port (27017).
- **Customize configurations:** Modify `application.properties` or `application.yml` (if present) to define settings for your application, including database connection details if your MongoDB instance is not on the default settings.



Here's a breakdown of the technologies you mentioned in your project:

**Maven:**

- A build automation tool specifically designed for Java projects.
- Manages project dependencies (libraries and frameworks your project needs), automating the process of downloading, configuring, and building them into your application.
- Defined in a central file called `pom.xml` (Project Object Model), which specifies project information, dependencies, and build instructions.
- Allows for efficient development, testing, and deployment of Java applications.

**Spring Boot:**

- A popular open-source framework built on top of Spring.
- Aims to simplify and expedite the development of Spring applications, especially web applications.
- Provides auto-configuration for common tasks like dependency injection, database access, and security, reducing boilerplate code.
- Offers a "convention over configuration" approach, where Spring Boot uses sensible defaults for most settings, reducing the need for extensive configuration files.
- Makes it easier to create standalone, production-grade Spring applications quickly.

**MongoDB:**

- A NoSQL (non-relational) database management system.
- Stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, allowing for schema-less data structures.
- Offers scalability and performance benefits for applications that don't require strict relational database schema enforcement.
- Well-suited for storing and retrieving large amounts of data with varying structures.
- Provides efficient querying capabilities for document-oriented data.

**Relationships in Your Project:**

- **Maven** manages the project dependencies, including Spring Boot and the Spring Data MongoDB library.
- **Spring Boot** provides the framework for building your backend application, leveraging features like auto-configuration and dependency injection.
- **Spring Data MongoDB** simplifies interaction with your MongoDB database within your Spring Boot application, offering a convenient way to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and interact with your data.
- These technologies work together to create a streamlined development experience for your Spring Boot backend application with MongoDB database integration.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Spring Data MongoDB:** Acts as a bridge between Spring Boot and MongoDB, providing abstractions for data access and manipulation.
- **Lombok (Optional):** An optional library that can reduce boilerplate code by automatically generating getters, setters, and other methods based on annotations. While not strictly necessary, it can improve code readability and maintainability.
